# lean-web-stack

A lean starter for AI-heavy web apps: **React + MUI + Redux Toolkit + FastAPI + Celery + Postgres + Redis + PydanticAI**.

- Two folders, two package managers you already know: `frontend/` (npm) and `backend/` (uv).
- No monorepo tooling. A `Makefile` and `compose.yml` at the root tie it together.
- One backend image runs three roles: **api**, **worker**, **migrate**.
- Works offline out of the box: the AI agents use a fake model until you set a real one.

```
browser ─► web (Vite in dev, nginx in prod) ─► /api ─► FastAPI ──► Postgres (+pgvector)
                                                  │  └─ SSE chat (PydanticAI agent)
                                                  └─► Redis ─► Celery workers ─► LLM jobs
```

## Quick start

Prerequisites: git, make, Docker Desktop (running), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Node 22.12+ (22.11 works with the current pins).

```sh
git clone git@github.com:bachtly/lean-web-stack.git myapp
cd myapp
make setup
make dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. You get a **Notes** page (create a note, click **Summarise**: that runs an AI job on a Celery worker) and a streaming **Chat** page.
API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs.

Ports busy on your machine? Edit `.env` (created by `make setup`), see [First day](docs/playbooks/00-first-day.md#ports).

## Everyday commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make setup` | install backend + frontend deps, create `.env` |
| `make dev` | Postgres + Redis in Docker; api, worker and web with hot reload |
| `make gen` | regenerate `backend/openapi.json` and the typed client `frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts` |
| `make check` | ruff, ruff format, mypy, pytest, eslint, tsc, vitest: run before every push |
| `make up` / `make down` | production-like stack in Docker (2 workers, nginx on `APP_PORT`) |
| `make help` | list all targets |

## When to add more tooling

This template stays small on purpose. Add Turborepo (caching, affected-only runs) when `make check` takes more than about 5 minutes; consider Nx when there are many apps and Python packages owned by several teams.
